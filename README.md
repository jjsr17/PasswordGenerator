# PasswordGenerator

    The purpose of the project is to create a password generator that will create a passcode based on different types of letters. You need to have a knowledge of javascript html/css in order to use and install it. 

    In order to use such file, you would click on the generate password button in order for a password to be generated. Once the button is clicked several menus will appear thus enabling certain types of letters and numbers into the random generator.
    At the end you will have a randomly generated password in the window.
